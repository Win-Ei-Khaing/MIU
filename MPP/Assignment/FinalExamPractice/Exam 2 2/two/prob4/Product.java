Knowledge from Java generics
Java generics provide stronger type-checking and make it possible to catch potential casting errors at compile time (rather than at runtime), and in many cases eliminate the need for downcasting. 
Generics also make it possible to support the most general possible API for methods that can be generalized. We see this in simple methods like max and sort, and also in the new Stream methods like filter and map. 
Generics involve type variables that can stand for any possible type; in this sense they embody a universal quality. Yet, it is by virtue of this universal quality that we are able to specify particular types (instead of using a raw List, we can use List<T>, which allows us to specify a list of Strings â€“ List<String> -- rather than a list of Objects, as we have to do with the raw List). 
This shows how the lively presence of the universal sharpens and enhances the particulars of individual expressions. Likewise, contact with the universal level of intelligence sharpens and enhances individual traits. 

Knowledge from Stream		
The stream API is an abstraction of collections that supports aggregate operations like filter and map. These operations make it possible to process collections in a declarative style that supports parallelization, compact and readable code, and processing without side effects. 
Deeper laws of nature are ultimately responsible for how things appear in the world. Efforts to modify the world from the surface level lead to struggle and partial success. Affecting the world by accessing the deep underlying laws that structure everything can produce enormous impact with little effort. 
The key to accessing and winning support from deeper laws is going beyond the surface of awareness to the depths within.
